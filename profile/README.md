**What is POGR**

POGR is every game developer's newest favorite platform. 

We allow game developers to access data that usually isn’t collected. We enable developers to decide what data is/isn’t being collected and the ability to visualize it how they want.

We replaced the services needed for game development: game data/analytics, user management, user profiles, and more by consolidating them into ONE solution. This system is a drag-and-drop-like solution for game engines that centralizes all analytics and will, in the future, allow you to manage tickets, CICD, infrastructure, and much, much more.

Here are a few benefits we wanted to outline regarding our player profiles. Our platform unifies players into a global hub. POGR will serve as the statistical fingerprint for the growing gaming world. These granular profiles help you, as a developer, gain real insights into your game while also allowing the gamer to showcase their achievements, stats, and more. For the first time, these profiles are linked directly to the players' real-world identity. 

All data collected is finally understandable. We made it simple for developers and non-developers alike to make informed decisions about their game: where are players dropping off during a campaign/quest line? What are the best ways to monetize your players so they feel valued authentically? Every bug submitted now has player context \[internet speed, location, computer build, etc.\].

If it seems like the possibilities are limitless, that's because they are. We appreciate anyone who supports us and is always open to connecting and hearing suggestions on improving POGR.

**Who are we**

We were strangers who met on Discord with the shared goal of creating the ultimate player profile. Along the way, we realized this problem was much more complex than building a ‘social network for gamers.’

Connor Ellison (CEO) is a seasoned gamer who worked early at FaZe Clan. He worked closely with some of the top creators in gaming as the space was exploding in popularity. Afterward, he took his network and connections in the space to run Syft, which made over 9 million net in 2019, pairing gamers with brands as Covid started to appear. These years in the center of the gaming world shined a light on many outstanding issues a profile network would solve, and with the capital to take a chance, POGR was born.

Randolph Aarseth (CTO) has over 20 years of experience in Infrastructure and backend engineering. He led teams at studios such as Final Strike Games, Allied Universal, and many Enterprise Companies and AA Studios within the industry. He also built Pokeworld, one of the first Discord bots that peaked at 1.9 million users and made over a million dollars selling consumable items within Second Life. When he heard Connor’s idea for POGR, he knew this was exactly what the gaming industry needed, but the entry point was through helping developers manage their games and communities.

**Why now**

A gap has formed in the market around tools to service the continuing rise of indie games and new studios. Other analytics services charge too much and are limited in their offerings. These different services also don’t associate with the user, making that data almost irrelevant.

A standardized statistical foundation that provides equal opportunity to this new wave of game developers must be established. Similar to how OG Facebook gave developers useful information to improve games on its platform, POGR is here to empower game developers by allowing them to understand and reach players in a way that previously *was never thought possible.* 

**Why this matters**

Game developers, new studios, and even indie developers shouldn’t be at a disadvantage. Anyone innovating or building deserves tools that aren’t priced out or gatekept by Triple-A studios/publishers or even Enterprise Companies.  
With genre-defending games like Hollow Knight (2017), Stardew Valley (2016), and Binding of Isaac (2014) and recent games that exploded, like Hades (2020), Palworld (2024), Hell Drivers 2 (2024), and Manor Lords (2024), so many new games are coming out and succeeding, yet these developers have not collected data. This hurts the players, community, and the growth of these new titles, and it doesn’t have to be that way.

POGR gives developers the tools they need to manage and grow their games for years to come. We bridge the gap between game developers and their communities, allowing for genuine innovation and aligning of the game's goals.
